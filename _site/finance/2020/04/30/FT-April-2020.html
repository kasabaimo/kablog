<ul>
  <li>Much faster recovery from the virus: Chinese manufacturing index rebounds. However, it is too early to be optimistic: countries relying on tourism have larger damage on economy; China may conduct lockdown again depending due to re-spread of the virus; one’s spending is another one’s income, we might enter the recession; higher risk of default and cutting dividends makes stock price lower.</li>
  <li>Many Japanese people believe that serving as a leader during the crisis is <em>short straw</em>: it is inevitable that rating drops. However, this is not true: Trump, Macron, Johnson, and Modi (India) all improved their ratings after the crisis. What they did was to clearly show their messages to its citizens, and do what is necessary at each moment, even if it contradicts what they have said before. In Japan, leaders often struggle with making different action, even when they know it is not working, because they value on consistency. It is clear that this tendency is part of their DNA, as Japan did not surrender in WW2 until the last moment.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="20200402">2020/04/02</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Collapse starts with vulnerable economy: Zambia may go into default.</li>
  <li>Plummet in oil price did not provide a single benefit to Russia: some argues that it somehow benefited from the price war as it expanded the market, but it is not true as the Russian oil’s quality is not as good as that of Saudi’s, and consumers are shifting towards Saudi’s high-quality but cheap oil.</li>
  <li>Disadvantages of stock buybacks are materialized: coronavirus shock leads to the shortage of cash to many companies and the lack of cash is partially due to extensive buybacks.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="20200403">2020/04/03</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The number of American unemployment benefits is now more than 6 million, 3000% more than usual time. BUT we should not be too pessimistic about this number: this is temporary shock, and it will recover after the lockdown; government stimulus package financially supports the unemployed; this is something that is expected; and the effect of business is mitigated since the owners do not have to pay salary, indicating the lower risk of business failure.</li>
  <li>US Office of Management and Budget estimates the value of a human life $7m to $9m. I personally think the lockdowns are necessary, but the economic return on those policies is questionable.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="20200406">2020/04/06</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Coronavirus accelerated the world:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Digitalization</strong>: More people work from home. As a result, Zoom’s stock price has surged.</li>
      <li><img src="/kablog//assets/images/ft/zoom.png" alt="Xixia" /></li>
      <li><strong>Politics &amp; Economy</strong>: Recent US-China trade war was the early signal of bloc economy, and this coronavirus shock will accelerate the move towards bloc economy.</li>
      <li><strong>Finance</strong>: Strong pressure on excessive fiscal and monetary policies around the world piles up government debt (e.g. US debt is now $9tn), and they are now taking MMT-like policies.</li>
      <li><strong>Education Gap</strong>: Tardy students would just play video games during lockdowns, while hardworking students spend their time effectively. This will ultimately leads to larger income gap.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="20200407">2020/04/07</h2>
<ul>
  <li>More strict regulations (e.g. higher capital requirements) are imposed to banks after 2008, but we observed very volatile financial market during this corona-crisis. This is partially due to algorithmic trading: they seize the orders during crisis, leading less liquidity.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="20200408">2020/04/08</h2>
<ul>
  <li>US citizens are underestimating the effect of coronavirus.
    <ul>
      <li>Many of them seems to be optimistic to the virus situation.</li>
      <li>In fact, the approval rate for Cuomo (NYC governer) is <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/03/30/new-yorkers-approve-of-cuomos-response-to-coronavirus-pandemic-poll/">now 87%</a>.</li>
      <li>But CLEARLY, NYC fails to manage the virus.</li>
      <li><img src="/kablog//assets/images/ft/nyccorona.png" alt="Xixia" /></li>
      <li>For now the number of new cases are declining but this only tells that virus is contained IF we continue this strict lockdown. Few people are considering how to re-start the economy.</li>
      <li>Some may think that the herd immunity is obtained soon, but this is not true. We can confirm it by a simple calculation.</li>
      <li>Consider the very pessimistic case: only 30% of coronavirus holders are diagnosed as the holders. Also, assume that the speed of infection stays same (ie. 140,000 people are infected in 1 month).</li>
      <li>(Time to herd immunity) = NYC total population ÷ (140,000 ÷ 30%) × (1 month) = <strong>18.5 months</strong></li>
      <li>Vaccine will be available in spring 2021 at the earliest.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="20200409">2020/04/09</h2>
<ul>
  <li>EU may collapse: eurozone finance ministers are not able to reach agreement on financial policies to tackle coronavirus. Speed is the priority to deal with this issue, but the conflict of interests of member counties delays the decision processes. If EU is not generous for fragile economies, EU will die.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="20200410">2020/04/10</h2>
<ul>
  <li>India is not next China: India last week announced sudden lockdown which lead to the movements of millions of urban people to rural area. India’s Supreme Court’s new ruling this week on coronavirus that all tests should be free distracts containment of the virus.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="20200413">2020/04/13</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The best actions we should take now are postponing problems: G20 countries are planning to propose 6 month freeze on loan payment of poor countries. Further, many countries are distributing money to people and companies like basic income. We need to keep in mind that they are not solving the problem but just avoiding panics and postponing problems. One thing different from 2008 financial crisis is that there is large effect on real economy. Debt moratorium would lead to hyper inflation or currency defaults, and basic income-like policies would accumulate government debt and future tax increase is inevitable. What’s more, the fight against the coronavirus is likely to be long term (at least until the end of 2021), so the 6 month freeze on loan payment would not be enough.</li>
  <li>Higher education system is hit hard by coronavirus: Wharton students submitted a petition for fee refund. With the higher costs for graduate schools, going to graduate schools may not financially make sense.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="20200414">2020/04/14</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The big banks are more stable compared with the time in the financial crisis in 2008, but this just migrated the risks to shadow banks. A large financial crisis may appear again with this corona shock. Now private equities, pension funds, central banks and other financial intermediaries are now bigger than banks.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="20200415">2020/04/15</h2>
<ul>
  <li>IMF forecasts 3% contraction in 2020 and 5.8 expansion in 2021 in the world economy, but this is too optimistic.</li>
  <li>The damage of coronavirus crisis will be more severe in developed countries than developing countries as developed countries relies more on service industry.</li>
  <li>Trump decided to halt funding to WHO. This is the “right” decision for democracy, but this is not the right thing to do. What US should do is to increase the funding to WHO to dilute the Chinese influence on the organization. WHO now may be corrupt, but it successfully eliminated various diseases such as smallpox in the past, and it is too early and immature to consider WHO is useless.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="20200416">2020/04/16</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Inflation expected &amp; shift in safe assets: IMF warns piling up government debts in worldwide. Mainly due to coronavirus, this year’s net global public debt will be 85.3%, while it was 69.4% last year. Ray Dalio today claimed that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-15/ray-dalio-says-investors-would-be-crazy-to-hold-bonds-now">holding a bond is crazy</a>. Currently, holding a bond may not be a good idea since we would have inflation in future. Buying zero interest bond would lead to loss of money in real term if we have inflation. I expect inflation since governments are printing distributing money to people in rapid pace. This does not necessarily damage society. Those who suffer from inflation is retired people who rely on cash to support their life, since inflation would not working age population much as their income would rise together.</li>
</ul>
<div align="center">
(real interest rate) = (nominal interest rate) - (expected inflation rate)
</div>

<h2 id="20200417">2020/04/17</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Japanese government withdraw the plan to distribute about $2,900 to those who suffered from severe economic damage, and pledged to handout about $900 to every individual. This new policy costs three times more than the previous one. We need to keep in mind that this is effective policy to prevent the spread of virus, but is <strong>not a effective economic stimuli</strong>. Since 2013, Japan imposes special corporate tax for reconstruction that adds 2.1% tax on corporate, residents’, and income tax. Frugal Japanese would save the money to prepare for future increase in tax (<em>no free lunch</em>).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="20200420">2020/04/20</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Aid scams spread in Germany. This is one of the supporting evidences why smaller government is efficient.</li>
  <li>Current increase in government spending must be cancelled out with one of 1. future increase in tax rate 2. (future) government austerity 3. increase in current account. In future, Americans need more saving than having debt to offset the current increase in government spending.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="20200421">2020/04/21</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Oil future price for next month hit negative for the first time in history. This is the demand-driven event, meaning the oil consumption dropped due to coronavirus, and there are no place to store excess oil. Though some people speculate the collapse in shale oil industry or another financial crisis, but as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-20/trump-wants-to-add-75-million-barrels-to-strategic-oil-reserve">Trump adds 75 million barrels to strategic oil reserve</a>, the damage is mitigated.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/kablog//assets/images/ft/oil.png" alt="Xixia" /></p>

<h2 id="20200422">2020/04/22</h2>
<ul>
  <li>ECB should act like central bank to save eurozone economy, which is estimated to shrink by 7.5% this year by IMF’s <em>optimistic</em> scenario. In today’s situation where risk of hyper inflation is low, it has huge firepower to intervene the market. The concerns are 1: German objections 2: exceeding its legal powers 3: destroy the political concerns.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="20200423">2020/04/23</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Although ECB is expected to act like central banks, it should carefully assess the solvency of lending countries (mainly Italy.) If it let Italy to freely access the capital, its default would affect severely across Europe.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="20200424">2020/04/24</h2>
<ul>
  <li>FT reports that Gilead’s clinical trial on vaccine failed, according to WHO. However, the trial “failed” because of lack of number of patients, not because the vaccine was not effective. It’s not WHO but FDA who judge the vaccine’s effect, so we should not be too pessimistic about it.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="20200427">2020/04/27</h2>
<ul>
  <li>FT’s writer suggests China to expand its financial influence on market by expanding its infrastructure and real estate investment. I don’t think it is a good idea. China already over-invests in those area. What it should do is to stop pursuing virtual growth by that kind of over-investment, and rather focus on long and sustainable growth. In near future, China will suffer from population aging and slower growth, thus it should start preparing against those problems.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="20200428">2020/04/28</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Black Swan hedge funds (36 South, Universa, capstone, etc.) are gaining profit in this crisis, but the return is not as good as we expected. One fund achieved more than 50% gain, but this gain is not large enough to recover the index up to 2015 level.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/kablog//assets/images/ft/eureka.png" alt="Xixia" /></p>

<h2 id="20200429">2020/04/29</h2>
<ul>
  <li>As mentioned in April 15th post, developing countries would have less severe damage by coronavirus, as they rely less on service industry. However, recently, local currency is excessively used for the government spending. In crisis, exchange rate collapse, and it will lead losses to foreign investors. This sift in risk is analogous to that of investment banks and private equity.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="20200430">2020/04/30</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The large social class difference in India now generates huge problems in the country. Many people are starving, and government is ignoring many suffering people by conducting strict lockdowns.</li>
</ul>
