# Week 1

## 3/10

- Russia disagrees with Saudi's suggestion to cut oil production and raise the price. Saudi then significantly dropped the oil price. As a result, stock prices went down.

 ![Xixia]({{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/ft/oilprice.jpg) 

- Investors avert risks: high volatility in risky assets leads to increasing popularity in government bonds and their low yields.
- Central banks are required to take some actions to deal with low stock prices and a possible recession.
- However, interest rates are already very low (i.e. liquidity trap). Thus, monetary policy is not enough.
- We need international cooperation when conduction monetary/fiscal policies as in the 2008 crisis. Without cooperation, currency rates could be destabilized, small countries may fall into default. But is it possible for current governments (many are populism, don't-care-others thinking)?

### Questions

#### Why did lower oil price lead to the lower stock price?
- Lower oil prices themselves are good for the economy, but oil companies' stocks went down. As a result, financial institutes lending money to those companies will suffer. (Remember that [the U.S. is now a net oil exporter](https://www.ft.com/content/9cbba7b0-12dd-11ea-a7e6-62bf4f9e548a))\\
Also, oil-producing countries expect a decline in future revenue, leading less investing which is not good for the economy.\\
As the world market is interconnected, it is not good for the world economy too.


## 3/11

- European economy just got out of recession in the late-2019 and early-2020, but they are suffering from the bad economy again.
- 3 negative effects of Saudi's oil price war:
    1. Fewer investments from oil-producing companies.
    2. Default risks of energy-related companies (or perhaps countries).
    3. Less consumption boosting due to coronavirus.
- Less new coronavirus cases in China.
    - President Xi's dilemma: no more quarantines for economy vs being afraid of re-spread of the virus.


## 3/12

- Biden is winning over Sanders. Our question: will they still fight each other or work together to beat Trump?
- Controversial arguments on the U.S. government reaction against coronavirus: president Trump wants business-as-usual, and plans to hold political gathering as scheduled, while Democrats are more cautious against it as they will hold meetings without audiences.
- President Trump said "[[W]hen you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that's a pretty good job we've done.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-conference/)," but now more than 900 coronavirus cases are confirmed. This is associated with higher uncertainty.
- U.S. lacks coronavirus test kits. The effect of the virus on its economy is unknown.



## 3/13

- 127,863 people are infected, and 4.718 death by coronavirus.

- Coronavirus’s effects on financial markets:

- |   Index    | Change on Mar-12 | Change from Feb-19 |
  | :--------: | :--------------: | :----------------: |
  |  S&P 500   |      -7.9%       |        -25%        |
  | Stoxx 600  |      -11.5%      |        -32%        |
  |  FTSE 100  |      -10.9%      |        -30%        |
  | Nikkei 225 |      -2.6%       |        -20%        |

- The sharp fall in American stock is partially due to Trump's ban on travel from Europe to US.

  - The action is criticized that it lacks scientific consideration.
  - The ban itself may have a small impact on the economy, but it gave rise to the uncertainty of Trump's actions, leading evasion from risky assets.

- Investors are disappointed by ECB's action:

  - European stock fall is due to ECB's announcement to not lower the interest rates. Market expectation was 0.1% cut (-0.5% -> -0.6%)
  - ECB: It's not our role to intervene in government debt markets.

- Why FED's action is important

  - Providing liquidity to domestic and **international** market is necessary to prevent the dash for cash
    - Why international? ... Many countries are using the dollar for international transactions.
    - How to provide liquidity to the international market? ... generous swap deals especially to emerging economies where the US dollar lacks.

### Terms I learned today:

- FTSE 100 (Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index)… share index of the 100 companies listed on the London Stock Exchange with the highest market capitalization.

### Questions

- How market expectations on policies (e.g. interest rate cut) are formed?
- How do we know the market expectation? Does someone announce it?
- The market is disappointed by the ECB decision to keep the interest rate. Then who is happy with ECB's 

#### Why cutting swap deals provides liquidity (ie. make dollar available) in foreign banks?

Swap is the contract to exchange cash or liabilities. 


S&P 500's movement this week

## 3/16

- A good point about the Fed's rate cut to zero is cooperation with other countries, as it leads to the stable currency exchange rate.
- Germany also starts to shutdown.
- The Fed rate is now almost 0%. The market rebounds about 9% as a result.
- Passive funds (Bridgewater, BlackRock) and Bridge water are losing money.



## 3/17
- U.S. stock market's reaction on the Fed rate cut was rather negative - it leads 6% down in stock price in the first 1 minute after the market is open. 
- Renaissance Technologies, Bridgewater, and  BlackRock suffer from big losses.

### Questions
- On March-3, the Fed cut the rate by 0.5%, but the stock went down. 


## 3/18

- Young people can act as usual sooner than old people.
- Even is domestic shutdowns are successful, international movement ban can prolong
- Running out of money, l.a.s yo depression.
- Poor people→get sick, no money to go to hospitals, forced to work
- No need to worry about moral hazard when central banks or government to prevent bankruptcy because is us once-in-a-century crisis


## 3/19
- Stock prices keep falling.
- Usually, it leads to the increase in safe asset prices, but this time it's opposite, indicating finds are collecting money to pay back their investors
- The US plans to conduct the direct cash handout
- Each handout gives a maximum of $1000 to people twice
- A payroll tax cut is not enough because it doesn’t help unemployed

## 3/20
- Why Bridgewater’s fund lost during corona shock: prices of all types of assets (stocks, bonds, commodities) went down.
- In the 2008 crisis, the bond price went up thus they are able to make profit
- But this time, all types of assets plunged
- This is because investors are in need of cash this time to prevent bankruptcy


## 3/23

- Democrats are doing what they should be doing: they are reluctant to giving large companies financial aids with the current plan. They require:
    - Prohibiting share buybacks
    - Limit executive compensation
    - To not delay the disclosure of the companies receiving the aid
    - Make non-profit organizations able to receive aids too  
- The end of the 2nd LBO bubble is here, but the scale is much smaller than the one in 2008.

## 3/24
- $2tn US financial aid fails to bring the stock price back

## 3/25
- This corona pandemic can be considered as an ethical challenge: international co-operation is necessary to recover from shock
- International measures can be providing medical care/goods, making new currency swap deals, financial aid to emerging economies.


## 3/26
- $2tn stimulus deal is approved by the US Senate.


## 3/27
- About 3.3 million Americans lost jobs due to coronavirus
![Xixia]({{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/ft/usjobs.png) 
- US wartime act will be exercised to promote the production of masks and hospital ventilators
- Trump's ambivalence may lead to the lower chance of re-election
- Many hedge funds are suffering. It's not only Blackstone.
- Fed returned BlackRock's Fink to ask for advice as the company has know-how on purchasing bonds.
- The US has now more cases than China


### Questions

- Even MMT-like policy could not bring the economy back. What else can we do to stimulate the economy?

### Terms
- TALF ... Make Fed be able to buy securities backed by student, car loans, small businesses




## 3/30

- India has now 1,024 Coronavirus cases and 27 deaths. Due to the POLICY FAILURE, the number will definitely explode soon: although there are millions of financially vulnerable urban migrants, immediate lockdown is announced. As a result, they need to make the journey home to support the loss of income. What the government should have done instead is 1: to conduct *helicopter money* policy to support those who lost their jobs and 2: conduct and announce more strict lockdown to avoid the panic exodus.
- China attempts to re-start its economy. It has been almost 4 months since the outbreak. Incidentally, experts estimate the UK's lockdown can last up to 6 months. By the end of 2020, we would have a good normal life. 

## 3/31

- The coronavirus shock raises the fear of sovereign defaults in low-income countries. This fear could propagate to high-income countries as many of them have large debts.




## 4/1

- Much faster recovery from the virus: Chinese manufacturing index rebounds. However, it is too early to be optimistic: countries relying on tourism have larger damage on the economy; China may conduct lockdown again depending due to re-spread of the virus; one's spending is another one's income, we might enter the recession; higher risk of default and cutting dividends makes the stock price lower.
- Many Japanese people believe that serving as a leader during the crisis is *short straw*: it is inevitable that rating drops. However, this is not true: Trump, Macron, Johnson, and Modi (India) all improved their ratings after the crisis. What they did was to clearly show their messages to its citizens, and do what is necessary at each moment, even if it contradicts what they have said before. In Japan, leaders often struggle with making different actions, even when they know it is not working, because they value consistency. It is clear that this tendency is part of their DNA, as Japan did not surrender in WW2 until the last moment.

 ![Xixia]({{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/ft/takeyari.png)

## 4/2

- Collapse starts with a vulnerable economy: Zambia may go into default. 
- Plummet in oil price did not provide a single benefit to Russia: some argue that it somehow benefited from the price war as it expanded the market, but it is not true as the Russian oil's quality is not as good as that of Saudi's, and consumers are shifting towards Saudi's high-quality but cheap oil.
- Disadvantages of stock buybacks are materialized: coronavirus shock leads to the shortage of cash to many companies and the lack of cash is partially due to extensive buybacks.


## 4/3

- The number of American unemployment benefits is now more than 6 million, 3000% more than usual time. BUT we should not be too pessimistic about this number: this is temporary shock, and it will recover after the lockdown; government stimulus package financially supports the unemployed; this is something that is expected; and the effect of business is mitigated since the owners do not have to pay salary, indicating the lower risk of business failure.
- US Office of Management and Budget estimates the value of a human life $7m to $9m. I personally think the lockdowns are necessary, but the economic return on those policies is questionable.


## 4/6
- Coronavirus accelerated the world:
    - **Digitalization**: More people work from home. As a result, Zoom's stock price has surged.
    - ![Xixia]({{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/ft/zoom.png)
    - **Politics & Economy**: Recent US-China trade war was the early signal of the bloc economy, and this coronavirus shock will accelerate the move towards the bloc economy. 
    - **Finance**: Strong pressure on excessive fiscal and monetary policies around the world piles up government debt (e.g. US debt is now $9tn), and they are now taking MMT-like policies.
    - **Education Gap**: Tardy students would just play video games during lockdowns, while hardworking students spend their time effectively. This will ultimately lead to a larger income gap.

## 4/7
- More strict regulations (e.g. higher capital requirements) are imposed on banks after 2008, but we observed a very volatile financial market during this corona-crisis. This is partially due to algorithmic trading: they seize the orders during the crisis, leading to less liquidity. 

## 4/8
- US citizens are underestimating the effect of coronavirus.
    - Many of them seem to be optimistic about the virus situation.
    - In fact, the approval rate for Cuomo (NYC governer) is [now 87%](https://nypost.com/2020/03/30/new-yorkers-approve-of-cuomos-response-to-coronavirus-pandemic-poll/).
    - But CLEARLY, NYC fails to manage the virus.
    - ![Xixia]({{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/ft/nyccorona.png)
    - For now, the number of new cases is declining but this only tells that virus is contained IF we continue this strict lockdown. Few people are considering how to re-start the economy.
    - Some may think that herd immunity is obtained soon, but this is not true. We can confirm it by a simple calculation.
    - Consider the very pessimistic case: only 30% of coronavirus holders are diagnosed as holders. Also, assume that the speed of infection stays the same (ie. 140,000 people are infected in 1 month).
    - (Time to herd immunity) = NYC total population ÷ (140,000 ÷ 30%) × (1 month) = **18.5 months**
    - Vaccine will be available in spring 2021 at the earliest.

## 4/9
- EU may collapse: eurozone finance ministers are not able to reach an agreement on financial policies to tackle coronavirus. Speed is the priority to deal with this issue, but the conflict of interests of member counties delays the decision processes. If the EU is not generous for fragile economies, the EU will die.

## 4/10
- India is not next China: India last week announced sudden lockdown which leads to the movements of millions of urban people to a rural area. India's Supreme Court's new ruling this week on coronavirus that all tests should be free distracts containment of the virus.

## 4/13
- The best actions we should take now are postponing problems: G20 countries are planning to propose a 6-month freeze on loan payment of poor countries. Further, many countries are distributing money to people and companies like basic income. We need to keep in mind that they are not solving the problem but just avoiding panics and postponing problems. One thing different from the 2008 financial crisis is that there is a large effect on the real economy. Debt moratorium would lead to hyperinflation or currency defaults, and basic income-like policies would accumulate government debt and a future tax increase is inevitable. What's more, the fight against the coronavirus is likely to be long term (at least until the end of 2021), so the 6-month freeze on loan payment would not be enough.
- The higher education system is hit hard by coronavirus: Wharton students submitted a petition for a fee refund. With the higher costs for graduate schools, going to graduate schools may not financially make sense.

## 4/14
- The big banks are more stable compared with the time in the financial crisis in 2008, but this just migrated the risks to shadow banks. A large financial crisis may appear again with this corona shock. Now private equities, pension funds, central banks, and other financial intermediaries are now bigger than banks.

## 4/15
- IMF forecasts a 3% contraction in 2020 and 5.8 expansion in 2021 in the world economy, but this is too optimistic.
- The damage of coronavirus crisis will be more severe in developed countries than developing countries as developed countries relies more on the service industry.
- Trump decided to halt funding to WHO. This is the "right" decision for democracy, but this is not the right thing to do. What the US should do is to increase the funding to WHO to dilute the Chinese influence on the organization. WHO now may be corrupt, but it successfully eliminated various diseases such as smallpox in the past, and it is too early and immature to consider WHO is useless.

## 4/16
- Inflation expected & shift in safe assets: IMF warns piling up government debts in worldwide. Mainly due to coronavirus, this year's net global public debt will be 85.3%, while it was 69.4% last year. Ray Dalio today claimed that [holding a bond is crazy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-15/ray-dalio-says-investors-would-be-crazy-to-hold-bonds-now). Currently, holding a bond may not be a good idea since we would have inflation in the future. Buying a zero-interest bond would lead to loss of money in the real term if we have inflation. I expect inflation since governments are printing distributing money to people at a rapid pace. This does not necessarily damage society. Those who suffer from inflation is retired people who rely on cash to support their life since inflation.
<div align="center">
(real interest rate) = (nominal interest rate) - (expected inflation rate)
</div>

## 4/17
- Japanese government withdraws the plan to distribute about $2,900 to those who suffered from severe economic damage and pledged to handout about $900 to every individual. This new policy costs three times more than the previous one. We need to keep in mind that this is an effective policy to prevent the spread of the virus, but is **not an effective economic stimuli**. Since 2013, Japan imposes a special corporate tax for reconstruction that adds a 2.1% tax on corporate, residents, and income tax. Frugal Japanese would save the money to prepare for a future increase in tax (*no free lunch*).

## 4/20
- Aid scams spread in Germany. This is one of the supporting pieces of evidence why smaller government is efficient.
- The current increase in government spending must be canceled out with one of 1. future increase in tax rate 2. (future) government austerity 3. increase in the current account. In the future, Americans need more savings than having a debt to offset the current increase in government spending.

## 4/21
- Oil future prices for next month hit negative for the first time in history. This is the demand-driven event, meaning the oil consumption dropped due to coronavirus, and there is no place to store excess oil. Though some people speculate the collapse in the shale oil industry or another financial crisis, although [Trump adds 75 million barrels to strategic oil reserve](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-20/trump-wants-to-add-75-million-barrels-to-strategic-oil-reserve), the damage is mitigated.
{:relief: style="text-align: center;"}

{: refdef}

## 4/22
- ECB should act as the central bank to save the eurozone economy, which is estimated to shrink by 7.5% this year by IMF's *optimistic* scenario. In today's situation where the risk of hyperinflation is low, it has huge firepower to intervene in the market. The concerns are 1: German objections 2: exceeding its legal powers 3: destroy the political concerns.

## 4/23
- Although ECB is expected to act as central banks, it should carefully assess the solvency of lending countries (mainly Italy.) If it let Italy to freely access the capital, its default would affect severely Europe.

## 4/24
- FT reports that Gilead’s clinical trial on vaccine failed, according to WHO. However, the trial "failed" because of the lack of a number of patients, not because the vaccine was not effective. It's not WHO but FDA who judge the vaccine's effect, so we should not be too pessimistic about it.

## 4/27
- FT's writer suggests China to expand its financial influence on the market by expanding its infrastructure and real estate investment. I don't think it is a good idea. China already over-invests in those areas. What it should do is to stop pursuing virtual growth by that kind of over-investment, and rather focus on long and sustainable growth. In the near future, China will suffer from population aging and slower growth, thus it should start preparing against those problems.

## 4/28
- Black Swan hedge funds (36 South, Universa, capstone, etc.) are gaining profit in this crisis, but the return is not as good as we expected. One fund achieved more than 50% gain, but this gain is not large enough to recover the index up to the 2015 level.
{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![Xixia]({{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/ft/eureka.png)
{: refdef}

## 4/29
- As mentioned in the April 15th post, developing countries would have less severe damage by coronavirus, as they rely less on the service industry. However, recently, the local currency is excessively used for government spending. In a crisis, the exchange rate collapses, and it will lead to losses to foreign investors. This shift in risk is analogous to that of investment banks and private equity.

## 4/30
- The large social class difference in India now generates huge problems in the country. Many people are starving, and the government is ignoring many suffering people by conducting strict lockdowns.


## 5/1
- Referring to the fight against coronavirus as *war* is too rough, but they share the characteristic that the large social changes will occur thereafter. One large change would occur in universities. Once professors give lectures online, they do not have to repeat lectures anymore. As a result, they can focus on their research or helping students. Of course, universities can choose not to adopt the changes and continue as before, their university ranking would gradually fall, and they will disappear by natural selection in the long term. The key is how to keep student satisfaction and provide students the opportunities to socialize.

## 5/4
- "[AI Economists](https://on.ft.com/3fjWign)" would no better than politicians and surveys. Although this idea of algorithmic economics helps businesses a lot, it is not really helpful for politics. This is not because the accuracy or precision of predictions is difficult for politics, but because there is no specific *objective function* in politics. Policies often faced with trade-offs, and AI economist is not possible to decide which side of trade-off is better. The same argument can be applied to AI-teachers. Should education prioritize high SAT scores, higher average salary, median salary, lower unemployment rate, or level of happiness? If all of them are important, how should we weight them?

## 5/5
- While the unemployment in the US hits record high, stock prices start to recover. The possible factors for this recovery are:
    - Some countries including China and Korea start reopening their economy earlier than expected, showing the possibility for early recovery in the US and Europe as well.
    - Unprecedented Fed intervention: it announced it will provide unlimited intervention.
    - The stock price is dominated by *expectations*. As investors have better expectations now, the stock price recovered, no matter the actual condition of the economy.

## 5/6
- The surge in demand for saving lowered interest rates, and this lead to higher debt-dependence. As a result, businesses became more fragile. According to researches, wider inequality in the US let the top 1% of people to save more, but less rise in investment. In contrast, the majority of people are in debt, which results in high reliance on finance and too much burden on borrowers, and demand inevitably relies on debts. To solve this too much reliance on debts, we can 1: reduce tax shield on debts, and 2: change government lending to equity purchases.


## 5/7
- Many amateur investors bought oil ETFs in oil price plunge in April 2020 are blind about rollover risk. The future ETFs need to sell the assets with short maturity and buy ones with long maturity to keep it as *future* ETF. If the current price is low but the future price is high, the amount of oil ETF holds will be less, and this situation is called "contango." Thus, theoretically, the loss by future ETF has no limit.

## 5/8
- Among all big-tech companies, Twitter is doing the worst job of taking down fake news. According to Oxford's research, 60% of fake content on Twitter are still online while the rate was 27% for YouTube and 24% for Facebook. Recently, Twitter Japan started collaborating with JCI-Japan, which is notorious for far-right behaviors. Governments should take immediate actions to let them take down that news.

## 5/11
- Many countries begin loosening restrictions in the hope of recovering their economies, but those loosening can easily be reverted. South Korea recently had no infections and loosed some restrictions, but recently confirmed 34 new cases, and set restrictions again. As it is far from getting herd immunity (estimated 3-5 years, assuming no virus mutation), the fight against the virus will be prolonged war.
- Warren Buffet said you can "bet on America, you are going to have to be careful how you bet". As he sold all of his stock of airline companies, we shouldn't blindly purchase US stocks anymore. In the financial crisis of 2008, he purchased a lot of stocks in the banking sector, but he is showing the opposite move in this coronavirus crisis. This move indicates the possibility of a permanent change in the US economy. We may think that the tech sector is safe to place to invest, but growing tech nationalism across the world makes the industry unstable.
- The Japanese finance ministry announced the new rule that foreign investors need to notify before they buy one percent of specific stocks. The stock includes Toyota, Sony, and some hotels, hot spring companies. Japan's low productivity is mainly due to lazy management and lack of shareholder activism caused by too much cross-ownership. The new rule worsened the low productivity of Japanese companies.

## 5/12
- Value investing is suffering: Berkshire Hathaway and value stock index (Russell 3000 Value index) recently kept losing the S&P index. Although value investing believed to perform well in the economic downturn, Berkshire Hathaway lost $50bn between January-March in 2020. The possible explanations for why value stocks are not performing well are:
    - Quantitative investing has changed market dynamics
    - The technology industry increases its power with strong market dominance, which does not show up in the balance sheet.
    Message: we need to take invisible elements into account. 
- Whether we can intentionally infect people coronavirus for vaccine development is under question, although it is safe to do it.

## 5/13
- S&P 500 index is now just about 12% lower than the beginning of 2020. It is not because investors are betting on V-shape recovery, but
    - Big tech stocks and healthcare industry stocks are performing well, and their proportions in the indices are large.
    - Fed intervention pours huge money into the market.
    - Tina (there is no alternative). The US is still a safe place to invest relative to other assets.

## 5/14
- After the crisis, the amount of debt in the public sector will be very large (fiscal deficit), # of defaults increases, very low-interest rate, higher tax, but no austerity policies as in the post-financial crisis in 2008. Rise in nationalism, protectionism will also emerge.

## 5/15
- The number of bankruptcy in the US in coronavirus crisis is very low for a recession: only 560 companies went into bankruptcy in April, and this is less than the 2017 level. The reasons why the number is small are:
    1. Very high cost to file Chapter 11.
    2. Chapter 11 is filed only when debtors have the incentive to do.
    3. Debt is collateralized and this makes bankruptcy negotiation complicated.
    4. Coronavirus makes asset valuations difficult.
    5. The number of judges is not enough.

## 5/18
- Masks are used for political purposes by China before. Now, the vaccine will be a huge political agenda. The CEO of Sanofi, France-based pharmaceutical company, said the US has the right to receive the vaccine first since they invested a lot for vaccine development. Macron complains it as French has been invested lot in Sanofi for long (€150m / year) and the vaccine should not be dominated by the law of the market. 
- The CEO of  Nomura Securities, Japan's largest security company, has been replaced this March. The new CEO aims to expand advisory work and private debt financing. In Japan, private equities are not fully active due to the strong restrictions, thus shareholder primacy is not very active. Thus, there would be a great opportunity in this area, although the economy is slowly shrinking.

## 5/19
- Capitals flow into hedge funds are more concentrated in a small number of large funds now. They often require high fees, but small funds are suffering from high costs to comply regulations. During the coronavirus crisis, large funds are relatively doing better than small funds.

## 5/20
- Both inflation and deflation can follow after the pandemic. For inflation, a huge increase in money supply and de-globalization can be the causes. For deflation, structurally weak demand and deflationary spiral can cause it.
- EU rule states companies with losses of more than 50% of their share capital are not able to receive financial aid. Many private equity-backed companies can't receive aid due to this. The private equity business model is accelerating the fragility.

## 5/21
- Although the Chinese economy slows down due to the virus and its government response against the virus is often criticized, the stability of the Chinese political structure is still stable. We used to believe that recent Chinese political stability is mainly supported by rapid economic growth. This is partially true, but President Xi's reform on social structure and failure in western countries handling the virus are helping the stability. China divides its citizen into peasant workers and urban citizens, and peasant workers are too powerless to rebel, although they most likely to dissatisfied with the government. The US attack against China and severe virus spread in the US and Europe enhance the Chinese nationalism. 

## 5/22
- Dollar will become more prevail currency after the crisis. During the coronavirus crisis, Fed intervened offshore dollar market by swap deals. The deals provided liquidity in dollars, resulting the stable market around the world. This benefited US since it reduce the shock in onshore dollar market too. With this move, dollar has gained more credibility.
- If the new EU fiscal policy proposal by France and Germany is approved, it will be the first case in EU history that it exercised a fiscal policy.
