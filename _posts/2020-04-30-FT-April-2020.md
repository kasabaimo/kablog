# Week 1

## 2020/04/01

- Much faster recovery from the virus: Chinese manufacturing index rebounds. However, it is too early to be optimistic: countries relying on tourism have larger damage on economy; China may conduct lockdown again depending due to re-spread of the virus; one's spending is another one's income, we might enter the recession; higher risk of default and cutting dividends makes stock price lower.
- Many Japanese people believe that serving as a leader during the crisis is *short straw*: it is inevitable that rating drops. However, this is not true: Trump, Macron, Johnson, and Modi (India) all improved their ratings after the crisis. What they did was to clearly show their messages to its citizens, and do what is necessary at each moment, even if it contradicts what they have said before. In Japan, leaders often struggle with making different action, even when they know it is not working, because they value on consistency. It is clear that this tendency is part of their DNA, as Japan did not surrender in WW2 until the last moment.
