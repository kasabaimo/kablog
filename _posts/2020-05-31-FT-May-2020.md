- Referring the fight against coronavirus as *war* is too rough, but they share the characteristic that the large social changes will occur thereafter. One large change would occur in universities. Once professors give lectures online, they do not have to repeat lectures anymore. As a result, they can focus on their research or helping students. Of course, universities can choose not to adopt the changes and continue as before, their university ranking would gradually fall, and they will disappear by natural selection in long term. The key is how to keep student satisfaction and provide students the opportunities to socialize.

## 5/8
- Among all big-tech companies, Twitter is doing worst job at taking down fake news.
