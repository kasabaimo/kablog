# Week 1

## 2020/03/10

- Saudi: "Let's cut oil production and raise the price"\\
  Russia: "No"\\
  Saudi then significantly dropped the oil price.\\
  As a result, stock prices went down.\\

- Investors avert risks: high volatility in risky assets lead increasing popularity in government bonds and their low yields.
- Central banks are required to take some actions to deal with low stock prices and possible recession.
- However, interest rates are already very low (i.e. liquidity trap). Thus, monetary policy is not enough.
- We need international cooperation when conduction monetary/fiscal policies as in the 2008 crisis. Without the cooperation, currency rates could be destabilized, small countries may fall into default. But is it possible for current governments (many are populism, don't-care-others thinking).

### Questions

#### Why did lower oil price lead to lower stock price?
- Lower oil price itself is good for economy, but oil companies' stocks went down. As a result, financial institutes lending money to those companies will suffer. (Remember that [U.S. is now a net oil exporter](https://www.ft.com/content/9cbba7b0-12dd-11ea-a7e6-62bf4f9e548a))\\
Also, oil-producing countries expects the decline in future revenue, leading less investing which is not good for the economy.\\
As the world market is interconnected, it is not good for the world economy too.


## 2020/03/11

- European economy just got out of recession in the late-2019 and early-2020, but they are suffering form bad economy again.
- 3 negative effects of Saudi's oil price war:
    1. Less investments from oil-producing companies.
    2. Default risks of energy-related companies (or perhaps countries).
    3. Less consumption boosting due to coronavirus.
- Less new coronavirus cases in China.
    - President Xi's dilemma: no more quarantines for economy vs being afraid of re-spread of virus.


## 2020/03/12

- Biden is winning over Sanders. Our question: will they still fight each other or work together to beat Trump?
- Controversial arguments on the U.S. government reaction against coronavirus: president Trump wants business-as-usual, and plans to hold political gathering as scheduled, while Democrats are more cautious against it as they will hold meetings without audiences.
- President Trump said "[[W]hen you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that's a pretty good job we've done.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-conference/)," but now more than 900 coronavirus cases are confirmed. This is associated with higher uncertainty.
- U.S. lacks coronavirus test kits. The effect of the virus to its economy is unknown.



## 2020/03/13

- 127,863 people are infected, and 4.718 death by coronavirus.

- Coronavirus’s effects on financial markets:

- |   Index    | Change on Mar-12 | Change from Feb-19 |
  | :--------: | :--------------: | :----------------: |
  |  S&P 500   |      -7.9%       |        -25%        |
  | Stoxx 600  |      -11.5%      |        -32%        |
  |  FTSE 100  |      -10.9%      |        -30%        |
  | Nikkei 225 |      -2.6%       |        -20%        |

- The sharp fall in the American stock is partially due to Trump's ban on travel from Europe to US.

  - The action is criticised that it lacks scientific consideration.
  - The ban itself may have small impact on the economy, but it gave rise to the uncertainty of Trump's actions, leading evasion from risky assets.

- Investors are disappointed by ECB's action:

  - European stock fall is due to ECB's announcement to not lower the interest rates. Market expectation was 0.1% cut (-0.5% -> -0.6%)
  - ECB: It's not our role to intervene government debt markets.

- Why FED's action is important

  - Providing liquidity to domestic and **international** market is necessary to prevent the dash for cash
    - Why international? ... Many countries are using dollar for international transactions.
    - How to provide liquidity to international market? ... generous swap deals especially to emerging economies where US dollar lacks.

### Terms I learned today:

- FTSE 100 (Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index)… share index of the 100 companies listed on the London Stock Exchange with the highest market capitalisation.

### Questions

- How market expectations on policies (e.g. interest rate cut) are formed?
- How do we know the market expectation? Does someone announce it?
- Market is disappointed by the ECB decision to keep the interest rate. Then who is happy with ECB's 

#### Why cutting swap deals provides liquidity (ie. make dollar available) in foreign banks?

Swap is the contract to exchange cash or liabilities.

- But this time, all types of assets plunged
- This is because investors are in need of cash this time to prevent bankruptcy


# Week 3

    - Make non-profit organizations able to receive aids too

# Week 4


## 2020/03/30

- India has now 1,024 Coronavirus cases and 27 deaths. Due to the POLICY FAILURE, the number will definitely explode soon: although there are millions of financially vulnerable urban migrants, immediate lockdown is announced. As a result, they need to make the journey home to support the loss of income. What the government should have done instead is 1: to conduct *helicopter money* policy to support those who lost their jobs and 2: conduct and announce more strict lockdown to avoid the panic exodus.
- China attempts to re-start its economy. It has been almost 4 months since the outbreak. Incidentally, experts estimates UK's lockdown can last up to 6 months. By the end of 2020, we would have a good normal life. 

## 2020/03/31

- The coronavirus shock raises the fear of sovereign defaults in low-income countries. This fear could propagate to high-income countries as many of them have large debts.
