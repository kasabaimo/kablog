# Thoughts


# 2020/03/23

- Democrats are doing what they should be doing: they are reluctant to giving large companies financial aids with current plan. They require:
    - Prohibiting share buybacks
    - Limit executive compensation
    - To not delay the disclosure of the companies receiving the aid
    - Make non-profit organizations able to receive aids too  
- End of 2nd LBO bubble is here, but the scale is much smaller than the one in 2008.

- US wartime act will be excersized to promote the production of masks and hospital ventilators
- Trump's ambivalence may lead to the lower chance of re-election
- Many hedge funds are suffering. It's not only Blackstone.

### Questions

- Even MMT-like policy could not bring the economy back. What else can we do to stimulate economy?

# Terms
- TALF ... Make Fed be able to buy securities backed by student, car loans, small businesses
