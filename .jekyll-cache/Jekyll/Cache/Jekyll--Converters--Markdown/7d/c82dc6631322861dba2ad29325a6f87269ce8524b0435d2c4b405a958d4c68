<ul>
  <li>Much faster recovery from the virus: Chinese manufacturing index rebounds. However, it is too early to be optimistic: countries relying on tourism have larger damage on economy; China may conduct lockdown again depending due to re-spread of the virus; oneâ€™s spending is another oneâ€™s income, we might enter the recession; higher risk of default and cutting dividends makes stock price lower.</li>
  <li>Many Japanese people believe that serving as a leader during the crisis is <em>short straw</em>: it is inevitable that rating drops. However, this is not true: Trump, Macron, Johnson, and Modi (India) all improved their ratings after the crisis. What they did was to clearly show their messages to its citizens, and do what is necessary at each moment, even if it contradicts what they have said before. In Japan, leaders often struggle with making different action, even when they know it is not working, because they value on consistency. It is clear that this tendency is part of their DNA, as Japan did not surrender in WW2 until the last moment.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Collapse starts with vulnerable economy: Zambia may go into default.</li>
  <li>Plummet in oil price did not provide a single benefit to Russia: some argues that it somehow benefited from the price war as it expanded the market, but it is not true as the Russian oilâ€™s quality is not as good as that of Saudiâ€™s, and consumers are shifting towards Saudiâ€™s high-quality but cheap oil.</li>
  <li>Disadvantages of stock buybacks are materialized: coronavirus shock leads to the shortage of cash to many companies and the lack of cash is partially due to extensive buybacks.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="20200403">2020/04/03</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The number of American unemployment benefits is now more than 6 million, 3000% more than usual time. BUT we should not be too pessimistic about this number: this is temporary shock, and it will recover after the lockdown; government stimulus package financially supports the unemployed; this is something that is expected; and the effect of business is mitigated since the owners do not have to pay salary, indicating the lower risk of business failure.</li>
  <li>US Office of Management and Budget estimates the value of a human life $7m to $9m. I personally think the lockdowns are necessary, but the economic return on those policies is questionable.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="20200406">2020/04/06</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Coronavirus accelerated the world:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Digitalization</strong>: More people work from home. As a result, Zoomâ€™s stock price has surged.</li>
      <li><img src="/kablog//assets/images/ft/zoom.png" alt="Xixia" /></li>
      <li><strong>Politics &amp; Economy</strong>: Recent US-China trade war was the early signal of bloc economy, and this coronavirus shock will accelerate the move towards bloc economy.</li>
      <li><strong>Finance</strong>: Strong pressure on excessive fiscal and monetary policies around the world piles up government debt (e.g. US debt is now $9tn), and they are now taking MMT-like policies.</li>
      <li><strong>Education Gap</strong>: Tardy students would just play video games during lockdowns, while hardworking students spend their time effectively. This will ultimately leads to larger income gap.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="20200407">2020/04/07</h2>
<ul>
  <li>More strict regulations (e.g. higher capital requirements) are imposed to banks after 2008, but we observed very volatile financial market during this corona-crisis. This is partially due to algorithmic trading: they seize the orders during crisis, leading less liquidity.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="20200408">2020/04/08</h2>
<ul>
  <li>US citizens are underestimating the effect of coronavirus.
    <ul>
      <li>Many of them seems to be optimistic to the virus situation.</li>
      <li>In fact, the approval rate for Cuomo (NYC governer) is <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/03/30/new-yorkers-approve-of-cuomos-response-to-coronavirus-pandemic-poll/">now 87%</a>.</li>
      <li>But CLEARLY, NYC fails to manage the virus.</li>
      <li><img src="/kablog//assets/images/ft/nyccorona.png" alt="Xixia" /></li>
      <li>For now the number of new cases are declining but this only tells that virus is contained IF we continue this strict lockdown. Few people are considering how to re-start the economy.</li>
      <li>Some may think that the herd immunity is obtained soon, but this is not true. We can confirm it by a simple calculation.</li>
      <li>Consider the very pessimistic case: only 30% of coronavirus holders are diagnosed as the holders. Also, assume that the speed of infection stays same (ie. 140,000 people are infected in 1 month).
  -</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<div align="center">
$$\text{Time to herd immunity} = \text{NYC total population} \div (\text{140,000}\div 0.3) \times \text{1 month} = 18.5 \text{months}
</div>
