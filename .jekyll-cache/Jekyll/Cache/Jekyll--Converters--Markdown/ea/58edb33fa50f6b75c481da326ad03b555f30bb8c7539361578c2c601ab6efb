  <li>We need international cooperation when conduction monetary/fiscal policies as in the 2008 crisis.

<h4 id="why-did-lower-oil-price-lead-to-the-lower-stock-price">Why did lower oil price lead to the lower stock price?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Lower oil prices themselves are good for the economy, but oil companies‚Äô stocks went down. As a result, financial institutes lending money to those companies will suffer. (Remember that <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9cbba7b0-12dd-11ea-a7e6-62bf4f9e548a">the U.S. is now a net oil exporter</a>)<br />
Also, oil-producing countries expect a decline in future revenue, leading less investing which is not good for the economy.<br />
As the world market is interconnected, it is not good for the world economy too.</li>

  <li>India has now 1,024 Coronavirus cases and 27 deaths. Due to the POLICY FAILURE, the number will definitely explode soon: although there are millions of financially vulnerable urban migrants, immediate lockdown is announced. As a result, they need to make the journey home to support the loss of income. What the government should have done instead is 1: to conduct <em>helicopter money</em> policy to support those who lost their jobs and 2: conduct and announce more strict lockdown to avoid the panic exodus.</li>
  <li>China attempts to re-start its economy. It has been almost 4 months since the outbreak. Incidentally, experts estimate the UK‚Äôs lockdown can last up to 6 months. By the end of 2020, we would have a good normal life.</li>
</ul>

  <li>The coronavirus shock raises the fear of sovereign defaults in low-income countries. This fear could propagate to high-income countries as many of them have large debts.</li>

<h2 id="41">4/1</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Much faster recovery from the virus: Chinese manufacturing index rebounds. However, it is too early to be optimistic: countries relying on tourism have larger damage on the economy; China may conduct lockdown again depending due to re-spread of the virus; one‚Äôs spending is another one‚Äôs income, we might enter the recession; higher risk of default and cutting dividends makes the stock price lower.</li>
  <li>Many Japanese people believe that serving as a leader during the crisis is <em>short straw</em>: it is inevitable that rating drops. However, this is not true: Trump, Macron, Johnson, and Modi (India) all improved their ratings after the crisis. What they did was to clearly show their messages to its citizens, and do what is necessary at each moment, even if it contradicts what they have said before. In Japan, leaders often struggle with making different actions, even when they know it is not working, because they value consistency. It is clear that this tendency is part of their DNA, as Japan did not surrender in WW2 until the last moment.</li>

  <li>Plummet in oil price did not provide a single benefit to Russia: some argue that it somehow benefited from the price war as it expanded the market, but it is not true as the Russian oil‚Äôs quality is not as good as that of Saudi‚Äôs, and consumers are shifting towards Saudi‚Äôs high-quality but cheap oil.</li>
  <li>Disadvantages of stock buybacks are materialized: coronavirus shock leads to the shortage of cash to many companies and the lack of cash is partially due to extensive buybacks.</li>

<h2 id="43">4/3</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The number of American unemployment benefits is now more than 6 million, 3000% more than usual time. BUT we should not be too pessimistic about this number: this is temporary shock, and it will recover after the lockdown; government stimulus package financially supports the unemployed; this is something that is expected; and the effect of business is mitigated since the owners do not have to pay salary, indicating the lower risk of business failure.</li>
  <li>US Office of Management and Budget estimates the value of a human life $7m to $9m. I personally think the lockdowns are necessary, but the economic return on those policies is questionable.</li>

      <li><strong>Politics &amp; Economy</strong>: Recent US-China trade war was the early signal of the bloc economy, and this coronavirus shock will accelerate the move towards the bloc economy.</li>
      <li><strong>Finance</strong>: Strong pressure on excessive fiscal and monetary policies around the world piles up government debt (e.g. US debt is now $9tn), and they are now taking MMT-like policies.</li>

      <li>But CLEARLY, NYC fails to manage the virus.</li>
      <li><img src="/kablog//assets/images/ft/nyccorona.png" alt="Xixia" /></li>
      <li>For now, the number of new cases is declining but this only tells that virus is contained IF we continue this strict lockdown. Few people are considering how to re-start the economy.</li>
      <li>Some may think that herd immunity is obtained soon, but this is not true. We can confirm it by a simple calculation.</li>
      <li>Consider the very pessimistic case: only 30% of coronavirus holders are diagnosed as holders. Also, assume that the speed of infection stays the same (ie. 140,000 people are infected in 1 month).</li>
      <li>(Time to herd immunity) = NYC total population √∑ (140,000 √∑ 30%) √ó (1 month) = <strong>18.5 months</strong></li>

  <li>India is not next China: India last week announced sudden lockdown which leads to the movements of millions of urban people to a rural area. India‚Äôs Supreme Court‚Äôs new ruling this week on coronavirus that all tests should be free distracts containment of the virus.</li>

<h2 id="413">4/13</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The best actions we should take now are postponing problems: G20 countries are planning to propose a 6-month freeze on loan payment of poor countries. Further, many countries are distributing money to people and companies like basic income. We need to keep in mind that they are not solving the problem but just avoiding panics and postponing problems. One thing different from the 2008 financial crisis is that there is a large effect on the real economy. Debt moratorium would lead to hyperinflation or currency defaults, and basic income-like policies would accumulate government debt and a future tax increase is inevitable. What‚Äôs more, the fight against the coronavirus is likely to be long term (at least until the end of 2021), so the 6-month freeze on loan payment would not be enough.</li>
  <li>The higher education system is hit hard by coronavirus: Wharton students submitted a petition for a fee refund. With the higher costs for graduate schools, going to graduate schools may not financially make sense.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="414">4/14</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The big banks are more stable compared with the time in the financial crisis in 2008, but this just migrated the risks to shadow banks. A large financial crisis may appear again with this corona shock. Now private equities, pension funds, central banks, and other financial intermediaries are now bigger than banks.</li>

<h2 id="415">4/15</h2>
<ul>
  <li>IMF forecasts a 3% contraction in 2020 and 5.8 expansion in 2021 in the world economy, but this is too optimistic.</li>
  <li>The damage of coronavirus crisis will be more severe in developed countries than developing countries as developed countries relies more on the service industry.</li>
  <li>Trump decided to halt funding to WHO. This is the ‚Äúright‚Äù decision for democracy, but this is not the right thing to do. What the US should do is to increase the funding to WHO to dilute the Chinese influence on the organization. WHO now may be corrupt, but it successfully eliminated various diseases such as smallpox in the past, and it is too early and immature to consider WHO is useless.</li>

  <li>Inflation expected &amp; shift in safe assets: IMF warns piling up government debts in worldwide.

Ray Dalio today claimed that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-15/ray-dalio-says-investors-would-be-crazy-to-hold-bonds-now">holding a bond is crazy</a>. Currently, holding a bond may not be a good idea since we would have inflation in the future. Buying a zero-interest bond would lead to loss of money in the real term if we have inflation. I expect inflation since governments are printing distributing money to people at a rapid pace. This does not necessarily damage society. Those who suffer from inflation is retired people who rely on cash to support their life since inflation.</li>

  <li>Japanese government withdraws the plan to distribute about $2,900 to those who suffered from severe economic damage and pledged to handout about $900 to every individual. This new policy costs three times more than the previous one. We need to keep in mind that this is an effective policy to prevent the spread of the virus, but is <strong>not an effective economic stimuli</strong>. Since 2013, Japan imposes a special corporate tax for reconstruction that adds a 2.1% tax on corporate, residents, and income tax. Frugal Japanese would save the money to prepare for a future increase in tax (<em>no free lunch</em>).</li>

  <li>As mentioned in the April 15th post, developing countries would have less severe damage by coronavirus, as they rely less on the service industry. However, recently, the local currency is excessively used for government spending. In a crisis, the exchange rate collapses, and it will lead to losses to foreign investors. This shift in risk is analogous to that of investment banks and private equity.</li>

  <li>Referring to the fight against coronavirus as <em>war</em> is too rough, but they share the characteristic that the large social changes will occur thereafter. One large change would occur in universities. Once professors give lectures online, they do not have to repeat lectures anymore. As a result, they can focus on their research or helping students. Of course, universities can choose not to adopt the changes and continue as before, their university ranking would gradually fall, and they will disappear by natural selection in the long term. The key is how to keep student satisfaction and provide students the opportunities to socialize.</li>

Although this idea of algorithmic economics helps businesses a lot, it is not really helpful for politics. This is not because the accuracy or precision of predictions is difficult for politics, but because there is no specific <em>objective function</em> in politics. Policies often faced with trade-offs, and AI economist is not possible to decide which side of trade-off is better. The same argument can be applied to AI-teachers. Should education prioritize high SAT scores, higher average salary, median salary, lower unemployment rate, or level of happiness? If all of them are important, how should we weight them?</li>

  <li>While the unemployment in the US hits record high, stock prices start to recover. The possible factors for this recovery are:
    <ul>
      <li>Some countries including China and Korea start reopening their economy earlier than expected, showing the possibility for early recovery in the US and Europe as well.</li>
      <li>Unprecedented Fed intervention: it announced it will provide unlimited intervention.</li>
      <li>The stock price is dominated by <em>expectations</em>. As investors have better expectations now, the stock price recovered, no matter the actual condition of the economy.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="56">5/6</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The surge in demand for saving lowered interest rates, and this lead to higher debt-dependence. As a result, businesses became more fragile. According to researches, wider inequality in the US let the top 1% of people to save more, but less rise in investment. In contrast, the majority of people are in debt, which results in high reliance on finance and too much burden on borrowers, and demand inevitably relies on debts. To solve this too much reliance on debts, we can 1: reduce tax shield on debts, and 2: change government lending to equity purchases.</li>
</ul>

  <li>Many amateur investors bought oil ETFs in oil price plunge in April 2020 are blind about rollover risk. The future ETFs need to sell the assets with short maturity and buy ones with long maturity to keep it as <em>future</em> ETF. If the current price is low but the future price is high, the amount of oil ETF holds will be less, and this situation is called ‚Äúcontango.‚Äù Thus, theoretically, the loss by future ETF has no limit.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="58">5/8</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Among all big-tech companies, Twitter is doing the worst job of taking down fake news. According to Oxford‚Äôs research, 60% of fake content on Twitter are still online while the rate was 27% for YouTube and 24% for Facebook. Recently, Twitter Japan started collaborating with JCI-Japan, which is notorious for far-right behaviors. Governments should take immediate actions to let them take down that news.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="511">5/11</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Many countries begin loosening restrictions in the hope of recovering their economies, but those loosening can easily be reverted. South Korea recently had no infections and loosed some restrictions, but recently confirmed 34 new cases, and set restrictions again. As it is far from getting herd immunity (estimated 3-5 years, assuming no virus mutation), the fight against the virus will be prolonged war.</li>
  <li>Warren Buffet said you can ‚Äúbet on America, you are going to have to be careful how you bet‚Äù. As he sold all of his stock of airline companies, we shouldn‚Äôt blindly purchase US stocks anymore. In the financial crisis of 2008, he purchased a lot of stocks in the banking sector, but he is showing the opposite move in this coronavirus crisis. This move indicates the possibility of a permanent change in the US economy. We may think that the tech sector is safe to place to invest, but growing tech nationalism across the world makes the industry unstable.</li>
  <li>The Japanese finance ministry announced the new rule that foreign investors need to notify before they buy one percent of specific stocks. The stock includes Toyota, Sony, and some hotels, hot spring companies. Japan‚Äôs low productivity is mainly due to lazy management and lack of shareholder activism caused by too much cross-ownership. The new rule worsened the low productivity of Japanese companies.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="512">5/12</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Value investing is suffering: Berkshire Hathaway and value stock index (Russell 3000 Value index) recently kept losing the S&amp;P index. Although value investing believed to perform well in the economic downturn, Berkshire Hathaway lost $50bn between January-March in 2020. The possible explanations for why value stocks are not performing well are:
    <ul>
      <li>Quantitative investing has changed market dynamics</li>
      <li>The technology industry increases its power with strong market dominance, which does not show up in the balance sheet.
  Message: we need to take invisible elements into account.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Whether we can intentionally infect people coronavirus for vaccine development is under question, although it is safe to do it.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="513">5/13</h2>
<ul>
  <li>S&amp;P 500 index is now just about 12% lower than the beginning of 2020. It is not because investors are betting on V-shape recovery, but
    <ul>
      <li>Big tech stocks and healthcare industry stocks are performing well, and their proportions in the indices are large.</li>
      <li>Fed intervention pours huge money into the market.</li>
      <li>Tina (there is no alternative). The US is still a safe place to invest relative to other assets.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="514">5/14</h2>
<ul>
  <li>After the crisis, the amount of debt in the public sector will be very large (fiscal deficit), # of defaults increases, very low-interest rate, higher tax, but no austerity policies as in the post-financial crisis in 2008. Rise in nationalism, protectionism will also emerge.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="515">5/15</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The number of bankruptcy in the US in coronavirus crisis is very low for a recession: only 560 companies went into bankruptcy in April, and this is less than the 2017 level. The reasons why the number is small are:
    <ol>
      <li>Very high cost to file Chapter 11.</li>
      <li>Chapter 11 is filed only when debtors have the incentive to do.</li>
      <li>Debt is collateralized and this makes bankruptcy negotiation complicated.</li>
      <li>Coronavirus makes asset valuations difficult.</li>
      <li>The number of judges is not enough.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="518">5/18</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Masks are used for political purposes by China before. Now, the vaccine will be a huge political agenda. The CEO of Sanofi, France-based pharmaceutical company, said the US has the right to receive the vaccine first since they invested a lot for vaccine development. Macron complains it as French has been invested lot in Sanofi for long (‚Ç¨150m / year) and the vaccine should not be dominated by the law of the market.</li>
  <li>The CEO of  Nomura Securities, Japan‚Äôs largest security company, has been replaced this March. The new CEO aims to expand advisory work and private debt financing. In Japan, private equities are not fully active due to the strong restrictions, thus shareholder primacy is not very active. Thus, there would be a great opportunity in this area, although the economy is slowly shrinking.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="519">5/19</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Capitals flow into hedge funds are more concentrated in a small number of large funds now. They often require high fees, but small funds are suffering from high costs to comply regulations. During the coronavirus crisis, large funds are relatively doing better than small funds.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="520">5/20</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Both inflation and deflation can follow after the pandemic. For inflation, a huge increase in money supply and de-globalization can be the causes. For deflation, structurally weak demand and deflationary spiral can cause it.</li>
  <li>EU rule states companies with losses of more than 50% of their share capital are not able to receive financial aid. Many private equity-backed companies can‚Äôt receive aid due to this. The private equity business model is accelerating the fragility.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="522">5/22</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Although the Chinese economy slows down due to the virus and its government response against the virus is often criticized, the stability of the Chinese political structure is still stable. We used to believe that recent Chinese political stability is mainly supported by rapid economic growth. This is partially true, but President Xi‚Äôs reform on social structure and failure in western countries handling the virus are helping the stability. China divides its citizen into peasant workers and urban citizens, and peasant workers are too powerless to rebel, although they most likely to dissatisfied with the government. The US attack against China and severe virus spread in the US and Europe enhance the Chinese nationalism.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="522-1">5/22</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Dollar will become more prevail currency after the crisis. During the coronavirus crisis, Fed intervened offshore dollar market by swap deals. The deals provided liquidity in dollars, resulting the stable market around the world. This benefited US since it reduce the shock in onshore dollar market too. With this move, dollar has gained more credibility.</li>
  <li>If the new EU fiscal policy proposal by France and Germany is approved, it will be the first case in EU history that it exercised a fiscal policy.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="525">5/25</h2>
<ul>
  <li>So-called new cold war is happening between US and China. US‚Äôs new regulation makes Chinese companies such as Baidu difficult to be keep listed on US stock exchange. With more protests in Hong Kong, China can lose its access to foreign assets and become more isolated.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="526">5/26</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The Japanese yen is stable around 106-108 per dollar, although many events happened. This week, Hong Kong restarted its protests, Japan reopens the economy, and Abe got the lowest approval rating. Yen is well known for its high sensitivity to market events, so this calm in exchange rate seems odd. In long run, the global recession by the coronavirus may lead to higher yen.</li>
  <li>Joe Biden said Trump is too soft against China over coronavirus. Whoever wins the next election, US-China relationship won‚Äôt be very good.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="527">5/27</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The conflict between US and China resembles that of UK and Germany and Great Britain in 19th century. If the conflict get worse, de-globalization and it takes long to recover the same globalization level.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="528">5/28</h2>
<ul>
  <li>‚Ç¨1.85tn EU‚Äôs recovery fund needs unanimous vote from its member states to be approved, thus its realization is unlikely. But in future, I expect EU to have a fiscal power as this recovery fund intended. EU is planning to fund it with taxation on digital giants and environment taxes.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="529">5/29</h2>
<ul>
  <li>It is expected that Fed‚Äôs balance sheet will exceed 45% of the GDP in the end of 2020. With the possibility of EU recovery fund, we are facing more MMT-like fiscal and monetary policies.</li>
  <li>Trump‚Äôs voter turnout is getting lower due to the failure in the virus control. He is betting on V-shape economic recovery by trying to re-open the economy to recover the supports. If this fails, I expect that he would use other tactics such as intervening other countries politics.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="61">6/1</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Coronavirus would deepen secular stagnation. Excess saving (‚âí rising debt) and weak demand has been a problem for the last decade, and the virus accelerated it. Now policy rates are below zero lower bound and the monetary policies are not functioning. Also, companies are more risk averse and there would be less investment. In fact, Google Japan stopped hiring new graduates 2020. With more than 40m people claimed for unemployment benefit in US, household spending will shrink. Also, given monetary policy not working, more intense fiscal policy will increase the government debt in near future as Japan did.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="62">6/2</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Trading ban for Chinese companies listed in US stock exchange would hurt US investors but not Chinese companies. With Luckin Coffee‚Äôs financial fraud and US-China near-cold war state, US will soon prohibit trading of the companies stocks which do not pass <a href="https://pcaobus.org/Inspections/Pages/default.aspx">PCAOB inspection</a>. Since Chinese companies are afraid of bribes being found, many of them will be delisted from US stock exchange. However, it is often the case that Chinese companies delist from the market with a large discount, and enlist in Chinese market with higher valuation, as in Qihoo 360‚Äôs case. In 2016, it eliminated US investors with $9.3bn valuation, and listed in Chinese stock exchange at $60bn valuation in 2018.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="63">6/3</h2>
<ul>
  <li>It had been long believed that small cap stocks will outperform a market in economic boom but not in the downturns. However, it was not the case over the past couple of years. This is because big-tech companies recorded the rapid growth recently. In the coronavirus crisis, some small cap companies performed well, but it is only for small fraction of them such as companies related to medical equipments and digitalization.</li>
  <li>Amid the coronavirus crisis and social unrest due to the death of George Floyd, stock price continue to rally. The stock rally in social unrest is not unusual event. The annual return of S&amp;P index was +11% in 1968 when Robert Kennedy is assassinated, +20% in 1998 when Bill Clinton accompanied the impeachment trial, and +4.5% in 2011 when Occupy Wall Street protest started.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="64">6/4</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Some argues that V-shape recovery is likely after the coronavirus crisis. Unprecedented policy responses contributes to the recovery, but we do not know whether we are the bottom of V-shape. The recovery depends on how fast vaccine is developed, and how much stimulus packages delivered.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="65">6/5</h2>
<ul>
  <li>When the stock prices recovered from the coronavirus crisis, the recovery is mostly led by tech industry which benefited from WFH (Work From Home) trend. The disparity of growth speed can also be observed within tech companies which assists WFH. Slack did not enjoy rapid growth as Zoom and Microsoft Team did. In essence, what type of industry a company belongs does not matter, but we need to investigate the business models of companies and how they are influenced by events/trends.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="68">6/8</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Although the unemployment rate has dropped about 1 percentage point from April to May, the actual rate could be higher. This is because furloughed employees are classified as being employed rather than temporal laid off.</li>
  <li>Japanese government bond‚Äôs yield curve has steepened (bonds are traded in lower prices) now. This is because traders anticipate the additional supply in JGB in July to finance the country. If the central bank increase the bond purchase, the yield curve will be flattened, but it may not do so because it will deteriorate the investment return on bonds, which lead to difficulty in financing pension funds.</li>
