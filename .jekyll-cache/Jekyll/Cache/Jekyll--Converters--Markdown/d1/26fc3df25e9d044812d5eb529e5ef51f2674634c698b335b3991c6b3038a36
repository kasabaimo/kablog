  <li>Investors avert risks: high volatility in risky assets lead increasing popularity in government bonds and their low yields.</li>
  <li>Central banks are required to take some actions to deal with low stock prices and possible recession.</li>
  <li>However, interest rates are already very low (i.e. liquidity trap). Thus, monetary policy is not enough.</li>
  <li>We need international cooperation when conduction monetary/fiscal policies as in the 2008 crisis. Without the cooperation, currency rates could be destabilized, small countries may fall into default. But is it possible for current governments (many are populism, don‚Äôt-care-others thinking).</li>

<h4 id="why-did-lower-oil-price-lead-to-lower-stock-price">Why did lower oil price lead to lower stock price?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Lower oil price itself is good for economy, but oil companies‚Äô stocks went down. As a result, financial institutes lending money to those companies will suffer. (Remember that <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9cbba7b0-12dd-11ea-a7e6-62bf4f9e548a">U.S. is now a net oil exporter</a>)<br />
Also, oil-producing countries expects the decline in future revenue, leading less investing which is not good for the economy.<br />
As the world market is interconnected, it is not good for the world economy too.</li>

    <p>The sharp fall in the American stock is partially due to Trump‚Äôs ban on travel from Europe to US.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The action is criticised that it lacks scientific consideration.</li>

  <li>India has now 1,024 Coronavirus cases and 27 deaths. Due to the POLICY FAILURE, the number will definitely explode soon: although there are millions of financially vulnerable urban migrants, immediate lockdown is announced. As a result, they need to make the journey home to support the loss of income. What the government should have done instead is 1: to conduct <em>helicopter money</em> policy to support those who lost their jobs and 2: conduct and announce more strict lockdown to avoid the panic exodus.</li>
  <li>China attempts to re-start its economy. It has been almost 4 months since the outbreak. Incidentally, experts estimates UK‚Äôs lockdown can last up to 6 months. By the end of 2020, we would have a good normal life.</li>
