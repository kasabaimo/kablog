<ul>
  <li>India has now 1,024 Coronavirus cases and 27 deaths. Due to the POLICY FAILURE, the number will definitely explode soon: although there are millions of financially vulnerable urban migrants, immediate lockdown is announced. As a result, they need to make the journey home to support the loss of income. What the government should have done instead is 1: to conduct <em>helicopter money</em> policy to support those who lost their jobs and 2: conduct and announce more strict lockdown to avoid the panic exodus.</li>
  <li>China attempts to re-start its economy. It has been almost 4 months since the outbreak. Incidentally, experts estimates UK’s lockdown can last up to 6 months. By the end of 2020, we would have a good normal life.</li>

<ul>
  <li>The coronavirus shock raises the fear of sovereign defaults in low-income countries. This fear could propagate to high-income countries as many of them have large debts.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Much faster recovery from the virus: Chinese manufacturing index rebounds. However, it is too early to be optimistic: countries relying on tourism have larger damage on economy; China may conduct lockdown again depending due to re-spread of the virus; one’s spending is another one’s income, we might enter the recession; higher risk of default and cutting dividends makes stock price lower.</li>
  <li>Many Japanese people believe that serving as a leader during the crisis is <em>short straw</em>: it is inevitable that rating drops. However, this is not true: Trump, Macron, Johnson, and Modi (India) all improved their ratings after the crisis. What they did was to clearly show their messages to its citizens, and do what is necessary at each moment, even if it contradicts what they have said before. In Japan, leaders often struggle with making different action, even when they know it is not working, because they value on consistency. It is clear that this tendency is part of their DNA, as Japan did not surrender in WW2 until the last moment.</li>
